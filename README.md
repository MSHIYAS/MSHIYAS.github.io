## Day2<br>
Today we learnt how we could document our work and experiences through github pages and how we could essentially use them in the future. The documenting actually feels amazing. It is like writing memories that wouldn’t fade with time. On a serious note, one can always record such experiences and learning and also share.<br>
##Day3<br>
HOW TO USE 3D PRINTER<br>
Design the work using any of design softwares.
Save the file in STL format.
Open the file in ‘CURA’.
Use the Adjustment Tools to position, scale and rotate the object if desired.
In the Sidebar, select the nozzle size and material you want to use. Make sure it matches the setup on the printer.
Select Helper Parts on the Sidebar. Set the desired strength and enable or disable support and build plate adhesion.
To view the result of the selected profile and support settings, go to the “View mode” and select “Layers”. In the bottom right corner, select “Save file” or “Save to USB” to save the print file.<br>
